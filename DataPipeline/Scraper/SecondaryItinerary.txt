{"course_title": "FA/ARTH 3999 3.00   New Media Art: From Duchamp to the Postdigital", "course_description": "This course examines the history of new media art with the goal of providing students with a wide ranging, yet in-depth survey of key figures, artworks, and texts from the last seventy years. The course begins by theoretically interrogating the notions of medium, media, and new media, looking to key figures such as Walter Benjamin, Marshall McLuhan, and Clement Greenberg, before taking a thematic rather than strictly chronological tour through new media art history. Classes consist of a blend of slide lectures, video screenings, student presentations, and group discussion. Classes are organized thematically with weekly topics that will include combinations of the following topics: print, performance, photography, television, cinema, video, animation, systems, networks, surveillance, the body, games and play, social media, virtual worlds, simulation, ecologies, digital decay, and the postdigital. To support this topical breadth this course draws readings from a variety of disciplines that include art history, cinema and media studies, game studies, anthropology, and environmental criticism. By the end of this course students will have gained a broad understanding of the many fluid theoretical relationships between contemporary art and technology, as well as a more specific historical knowledge of key figures and objects with the new media art canon. Open to non-majors."}

{"course_title": "SC/BIOL 4070 3.00   Behavioural Ecology", "course_description": "Behavioural ecology focuses on the behavioural interactions among individuals at both the intraspecific level in natural populations and the interspecific level in natural communities. Behavioural ecology asks questions about proximate and ultimate causes of behaviour, the development of behaviour, the flexibility of behaviour and learning, the adaptive value of behaviour for survival and reproduction, and the phylogenetic relationships among diverse behavioural patterns. In an overarching sense, it considers behavioural interactions against the metric of evolutionary fitness. A common focus of behavioural ecologists' research is to consider how efficiently animals use their time and energy in obtaining mates and resources against measures of survival and reproductive success, including analyses of the trade-offs associated with optimizing the use of time and energy. This course explores the many behavioural contexts that are manifest in natural populations of animals. Major themes include (a) behaviours under competition, including evolutionary stable strategies, frequency dependence,and the application of game theory; (b) behavioural plasticity; (c) changing behaviours in environments of changing or complex selective pressures; (d) territorial behaviour and economic defendability; (e) sex-specific patterns of behaviour in the mating realm, including the operation of sexual selection, the phylogeny of mating systems, the mediation of challenges based in sexual conflict, and behaviourally flexible alternative mating strategies; (f) patterns of behaviour related to parenting, including mother-father conflict, parent offspring conflict, and sibling conflict; (g) both antagonistic and cooperative social behaviours, including alloparenting and the special case of social insects;and (h) communication and signaling behaviours in diverse sensory realms.

For each idea/topic/problem relevant mathematical ideas and techniques are recalled and/or derived so as to provide a deeper understanding of the Economic issue and how it can be resolved, if necessary.

This sequence leads naturally to the notion of Revenue (the product of quantity demanded and price) where nonlinear functions are analyzed using mathematical techniques that include derivatives. This sequence culminates with notions of prices that maximize revenue subject to a given demand function. A large number of such topic sequences involving univariate functions are examined.

The role of interpersonal dynamics-such as affect, power, inner worlds, past histories, and emotional reality- are also examined as conditions that situate learners and teachers.

It studies the influence of those who lack direct authority over educational institutions but who may well influence the agendas and policy choices of governments, school boards, post-secondary educational decision-making bodies.

The course begins by introducing students to a broad discussion of community and how ideas of community can inform the work of community organizations. It then builds on multiple understandings of community as theory, as place, as method, as identity, as ideology, as policy and practice to review and rethink the work of community organizations as community resources providing education for the learning needs, interests and aspirations of community members.

The course is designed to create a method for analyzing contradictory motives, historical processes at work, and the effects of influencing the minds and hearts of others.

{"course_title": "SC/ENVB 4070 3.00   Behavioural Ecology", "course_description": "Behavioural ecology focuses on the behavioural interactions among individuals at both the intraspecific level in natural populations and the interspecific level in natural communities. Behavioural ecology asks questions about proximate and ultimate causes of behaviour, the development of behaviour, the flexibility of behaviour and learning, the adaptive value of behaviour for survival and reproduction, and the phylogenetic relationships among diverse behavioural patterns. In an overarching sense, it considers behavioural interactions against the metric of evolutionary fitness. A common focus of behavioural ecologists' research is to consider how efficiently animals use their time and energy in obtaining mates and resources against measures of survival and reproductive success, including analyses of the trade-offs associated with optimizing the use of time and energy. This course explores the many behavioural contexts that are manifest in natural populations of animals. Major themes include (a) behaviours under competition, including evolutionary stable strategies, frequency dependence,and the application of game theory; (b) behavioural plasticity; (c) changing behaviours in environments of changing or complex selective pressures; (d) territorial behaviour and economic defendability; (e) sex-specific patterns of behaviour in the mating realm, including the operation of sexual selection, the phylogeny of mating systems, the mediation of challenges based in sexual conflict, and behaviourally flexible alternative mating strategies; (f) patterns of behaviour related to parenting, including mother-father conflict, parent offspring conflict, and sibling conflict; (g) both antagonistic and cooperative social behaviours, including alloparenting and the special case of social insects;and (h) communication and signaling behaviours in diverse sensory realms.
