Classes consist of a blend of slide lectures, video screenings, student presentations, and group discussion. Classes are organized thematically with weekly topics that will include combinations of the following topics: print, performance, photography, television, cinema, video, animation, systems, networks, surveillance, the body, games and play, social media, virtual worlds, simulation, ecologies, digital decay, and the postdigital. To support this topical breadth this course draws readings from a variety of disciplines that include art history, cinema and media studies, game studies, anthropology, and environmental criticism. By the end of this course students will have gained a broad understanding of the many fluid theoretical relationships between contemporary art and technology, as well as a more specific historical knowledge of key figures and objects with the new media art canon. Open to non-majors."}

{"course_title": "SC/BIOL 4070 3.00   Behavioural Ecology", "course_description": "Behavioural ecology focuses on the behavioural interactions among individuals at both the intraspecific level in natural populations and the interspecific level in natural communities. Behavioural ecology asks questions about proximate and ultimate causes of behaviour, the development of behaviour, the flexibility of behaviour and learning, the adaptive value of behaviour for survival and reproduction, and the phylogenetic relationships among diverse behavioural patterns. In an overarching sense, it considers behavioural interactions against the metric of evolutionary fitness. A common focus of behavioural ecologists' research is to consider how efficiently animals use their time and energy in obtaining mates and resources against measures of survival and reproductive success, including analyses of the trade-offs associated with optimizing the use of time and energy.

{"course_title": "SC/ENVB 4070 3.00   Behavioural Ecology", "course_description": "Behavioural ecology focuses on the behavioural interactions among individuals at both the intraspecific level in natural populations and the interspecific level in natural communities. Behavioural ecology asks questions about proximate and ultimate causes of behaviour, the development of behaviour, the flexibility of behaviour and learning, the adaptive value of behaviour for survival and reproduction, and the phylogenetic relationships among diverse behavioural patterns. In an overarching sense, it considers behavioural interactions against the metric of evolutionary fitness. A common focus of behavioural ecologists' research is to consider how efficiently animals use their time and energy in obtaining mates and resources against measures of survival and reproductive success, including analyses of the trade-offs associated with optimizing the use of time and energy. This course explores the many behavioural contexts that are manifest in natural populations of animals. Major themes include (a) behaviours under competition, including evolutionary stable strategies, frequency dependence,and the application of game theory; (b) behavioural plasticity; (c) changing behaviours in environments of changing or complex selective pressures; (d) territorial behaviour and economic defendability; (e) sex-specific patterns of behaviour in the mating realm, including the operation of sexual selection, the phylogeny of mating systems, the mediation of challenges based in sexual conflict, and behaviourally flexible alternative mating strategies; (f) patterns of behaviour related to parenting, including mother-father conflict, parent offspring conflict, and sibling conflict; (g) both antagonistic and cooperative social behaviours, including alloparenting and the special case of social insects;and (h) communication and signaling behaviours in diverse sensory realms.

The first is to help students take a more structured and scientific approach to the evaluation of data. Managers are literally bombarded with data (the information overload problem) and must be able to filter and assess the quality of such data before inputting into managerial decision models. The ability to evaluate the quality of data and to make generalizations from it using the principles of statistical inference are critical skills for all mangers. The second objective of the course is to show how risk and uncertainty can be incorporated into decision making using techniques such as Probability theory and Bayesian inference. The third objective to show how data is qualitatively evaluated using the principles of evidence. Managers should be adept in evaluating both the sufficiency and persuasiveness of evidence used in decision models. The fourth objective is to show students how to prepare a research proposal to address any business problem. This is obviously essential for students pursuing the major paper option, but any manager benefits from recognizing when sound methodological principles have been followed in researching a business question. Managers read and possibly rely on many research reports over their careers and it is important to be able to distinguish good research from weak research."}

With this comes increased population density, economic disparities and increased cultural, ethic, racial and religious diversity. Public institutions, and schools in particular, are charged with the responsibility of addressing the resultant challenges. Using Toronto as an example, the course begins by examining the question: What characterizes urban schools We then go on to examine the historical, social, economis and political issues in the city and investigate how the demographic changes in particular have affected the education system. What changes have occured in the teaching, professional and administrative staff of the schools in term of representation What curricula, programmatic and pedagogical changes have occured? What are the challenges and tensions that the schools face as they attempt to accomodate diverse cultures? Schools in Toronto will be investigated and used as case studies. Through urban theory, field visits and individual assignments we will investigate the extent to which schools' currucula, program and staff representatives are responsive to the needs of today's students. Special attention will be paid to the roles of educators, students and parents in helping address educational, cultural and social issues.

Multilingual education will be viewed in multiple ways, incorporating internal and international responses to globalization and multiculturalism. In our world today, people live in increasingly multicultural, multilingual countries where historical concepts of belonging are under pressure to respond to current cultural realities. Technological advances of the late twentieth century have simultaneaously provided people with the means to move around the globe much more easily and drawn edges of the world closer within virtual space, such that cross-glabal communications take place in nanoseconds.

A range of fundamental questions may be recurring themes as we discuss our material. Such questions include; what exactly do we mean by regulation? Is it a coherent concept? Does it necessarily involve the state acting in some directive capacity? Is a regulatory agency required? What produces regulatory change? Do lawyers have a different understanding of regulation than non-lawyers? What are the indicia of \u0093good\u0094 regulation? To what extent are regulatory norms or practices influenced by broader social, political or economic developments, such as globalization, neo-liberalism, or technological determinism? What are the tools of regulatory intervention? Is the distinction between social and economic regulation a viable one? How does the idea of \u0093governance\u0094 differ from the idea of \u0093regulation\u0094? What are the new institutions of governance in the 21st century?

There will be an emphasis on how theoretical understandings must underpin notions of pedagogy and classroom practice, and how practice can be interrogated in light of these theoretical frameworks. The expectation is that effective practitioners have a strong sense of what they know and how they know it, and what they are doing and why they are doing it. The general approach of the course will be exploratory rather than didactic. At all levels, learning can be thought of as research: an active construction of personal knowledge, based on formulating and testing hypotheses and, in light of an evaluation of the results, modifying one's beliefs and practices. In this spirit, we shall attempt to make connections between the reading, writing and discussion that take place in the course, and the reading, writing and discussion of the classroom setting. Class sessions will vary in format and will include discussions of the readings which are set for each week, lectures, guest presentations and work on individual and group projects.

We begin by studying how gravity triggers fusion reactions in starts that create heat, light, and every element in our bodies except hydrogen: overall, stars shine by converting mass into energy (Einstein's E=mc^2). We discuss how we can use the corpses of stars (white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes) to probe how space and time are related via Einstein's theories of relativity. We examine how stars are bound together into galaxies by gravity and how to use various wavelengths of light to determine why there are different types of galaxies: elegant spirals, massive ellipticals, and faint dwarf galaxies. We learn how the Doppler effect reveals that dark matter must produce some of the gravity that binds stars into galaxies, galaxies into clusters of galaxies, and clusters of galaxies into superclusters. We explore how we can use distant galaxies to study the development of the universe over its entire history, including the increasing importance of dark energy. We confront both the earliest instants and the far future of our universe's history: what we know, what we still hope to learn, and what we think we can ever learn.
